| `user_id`          | FK → users    | The user who placed the order                                |
| `status`           | ENUM / string | e.g., 'pending', 'paid', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled' |

## TL;DR – Your Minimum Setup ✅

If you're just getting started, you can simplify and **keep only**:

* `order`
* `order_items`

And optionally later add:

* `order_status_history`
* `payments`
* `shipping`
* `addresses`

Would you like me to help write the SQL schema for any of these?
